Unless stated otherwise, all these source files are my own creations and you can do with them basically what you want. I would be happy to receive some comments if tasks or solutions are messed up and will happily accept good contributions as long as they do not require me to change this copyright note. (Of course I'm willing to mention contributors in this file, and if you contribute anything containing your name I will of course leave the name in the source file.)
