1. Implement the function is_prime in is_prime.c 

2. Add some tests to test.c

3. Run ./build.sh
You should get two binaries:

your_test_for_solution:
	This binary contains the tests you implemented and runs them against a bad implementation of "is_prime".

test_for_your_solution: 
	This binary contains some predefined tests and runs them against your implementation of "is_prime"

your_test_for_your_solution:
	This binary contains the tests you implemented and runs them against your implementation of "is_prime"
