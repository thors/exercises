This repository contains some tasks and solutions for programmers. 
It might be uused for self-entertainment, for job-interviews 
or to prepare yourself for interviews.

WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET VERY ADVANCED! IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL,
BUT MAKE SURE YOU CHECKED THE TASKS AND PROPOSED SOLUTIONS YOURSELF
BEFORE USING IT IN ANY PROFFESSIONAL CONTEXT! I WON'T TAKE ANY 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMBARRESSING SITUATIONS CAUSED BY MESSED UP 
TASKS OR SOLUTIONS!

There are three folders:

texhelper: 
	Forget about this one for now. I plan to document all the stuff using
	LaTeX, but for now this folder is useless.

solutions:
	This folder contains solutions to the exercises, some additional infos
	etc. Look for a readme.txt, if it exists it will help understand the 
	solutions.
	
	* This folder should not be shown to the examinee!

tasks:
	This folder contains some programming tasts. There should be a 
	readme.txt in each folder explaining what is expected from the 
	examinee
